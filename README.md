## About the Project  
This is my first personal project—a YouTube Clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It fetches videos from the YouTube API and includes additional features such as theme switching and a Shorts section.  
I built this project to practice working with APIs, improve my frontend skills, and explore JavaScript interactivity.

## Features  
✅ Utilizes YouTube's API to load videos  
✅ Toggle button for switching themes (Dark/Light Mode)  
✅ Shorts section for quick video content
